Hi there. I decided to create this repo tho document my journey diving into Active Directory realm.

I will focus on everything from:

1. Basic & Theory
2. Setting up a lab environment for learning.
3. Installing and Configuring a Domain controller.
4. Attacking a misconfigured environment.
5. Defending & Securing the environment.
6. Best Practices.

I'm also gonna be sharing resources and learning material in regards to the same.

I hope this project will be off great help to you and many others.

If you feel this project is beneficial, feel free to share with like minded fellows in the community.

Enjoy.
